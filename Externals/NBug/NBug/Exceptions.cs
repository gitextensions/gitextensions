		/// the action block is simply filtered to be sent as an error report, and never actually caught or handled. Filters all
		/// the exceptions inside the action body and queues an error report. Note that the exceptions are not actually handled,
		/// but filtered, so if the exception is left unhandled in an upper block, it will crash the application. This is very
		/// useful for situations where you need to log exceptions inside a code block and get a good minidump of the exception.
		/// Use the <see cref="Handle(bool,Action)"/> method to actually handle the exception and show an exception dialog to the
		/// user and shut down the application gracefully (if set so). You can simply use <c>Filter(() => { MyCodeHere(); })</c>

		/// parameter set to <see langword="false"/>. You can simply use <c>Handle(true, () => { MyCodeHere(); })</c>
