By example of IconCherryPick.png
--------------------------------

1. Open IconCherryPick.png (the source icon) with for example Paint.NET (not Gimp it saves the bmp in the wrong format)

2. Replace all transparency with color (0, 254, 0)

3. Save as bmp (24 Bit color depth)

4. Open VS, open Resources.resx, doubleclick on icon 15 to check if the created bmp can be loaded.
