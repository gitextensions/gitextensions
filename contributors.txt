By signing this agreement, you are warranting and representing that
you have the right to release code contributions or other content free
of any obligations to third parties and are granting Henk Westhuis and

You understand that The Git Extensions Project may or may not incorporate
your contribution and you warrant and represent the following:

1. I am the creator of all my contributions. I am the author of all
   contributed work submitted and further warrant and represent that
   such work is my original creation and I have the right to license
   it to The Git Extensions Project for release under the MIT and/or GPL
   license. I hereby grant The Git Extensions Project a nonexclusive,
   irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce,
   distribute, prepare derivative works, and otherwise use my
   contributions as part of the Git Extensions project, associated
   documentation, books, and tools at no cost to The Git Extensions Project.

2. I have the right to submit. This submission does not violate the
   rights of any person or entity and that I have legal authority over
   this submission and to make this certification.

3. If I violate another's rights, liability lies with me. I agree to
   defend, indemnify, and hold The Git Extensions Project and Git Extensions
   users harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorney
   fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of my violation
   of these terms and conditions or my violation of the rights of
   another person or entity.

4. I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are
   public and that a record of the contribution (including all
   personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
