# Instructions for GitHub and VisualStudio Copilot

<https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-21-custom-repository-instructions-are-now-available-for-copilot-on-github-com-public-preview/>

## General

* Make only high confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes.
* Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features.
* Files must have CRLF line endings.
* When creating or modifying code, follow all StyleCop analyzer rules.
* Test changes locally or verify StyleCop compliance before committing when possible.

## Comments

* Add const with speaking name instead of using magic numbers. Avoid hard-to-maintain comments which contain the magic number again.
* Omit comments which just describe _what_ is done. In situations where a comment may be necessary describe _why_ an implementation was chosen.
* In XML documentation, use proper XML keywords like "<see langword="true" />".

## Formatting

* Apply code-formatting style defined in `.editorconfig`.
* Prefer file-scoped namespace declarations and single-line using directives.
* Insert a newline before the opening curly brace of any code block (e.g., after `if`, `for`, `while`, `foreach`, `using`, `try`, etc.).
* Ensure that the final return statement of a method is on its own line.
* Use pattern matching and switch expressions wherever possible.
* Use `nameof` instead of string literals when referring to member names.
* Local methods must be 
    - placed at the end of the parent method,
    - sorted in alphabetical order,
    - preceded with a `return` statement.
  For example:
  ```cs
  private void MyMethod()
  {
      // implementation

      return;

      static void FirstLocalMethod1() { ... }

      static int SecondLocalMethod1() { ... }
  }
  ```
* Do not add trailing whitespace to any lines (StyleCop SA1028).
* Add blank lines after closing braces when required (StyleCop SA1513).

## Variable Declarations

* Never use `var` for primitive types. Use `var` only when the type is obvious from context. When in doubt, opt for an explicit type declaration.
* Prefer simplified "new()" construct over to "new MyType()" where the type is already declared.
  For example: "MyType t = new()" instead of "var t = new MyType()" or "MyType t = new MyType()".

## Nullable Reference Types

* Declare variables non-nullable, and check for `null` at entry points.
* Always use `is null` or `is not null` instead of `== null` or `!= null`.
* Trust the C# null annotations and don't add null checks when the type system says a value cannot be null.

## Testing

* We use NUnit SDK.
* Do not emit "Act", "Arrange" or "Assert" comments.
* The test names must follow snake-casing in the suffix BUT keeping the methods under test intact.
  For example, a test for a method "MyMethod" should be named as "MyMethod_should_return_expected".
* Do not repeat in a comment what the test name already expresses.
* Use `NSubstitute` for mocking.
* Use `FluentAssertions` for assertions, i.e. do not use `ClassicAssert`.

## Commit Messages

* Use https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ for commit messages.
* Note especially that changes in directory src/app/GitExtensions.Extensibility affects the version for the plugin interface. This must be annotated in the commit message.
