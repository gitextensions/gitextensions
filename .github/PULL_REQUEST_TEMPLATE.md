## Merge strategy

<!-- Change the following if the merge strategy should be changed:
- Squash merge (maintainer to decide merge message, PR submitter should cleanup commits/messages at PR approval).
- Rebase merge (PR submitter must change the commit message for the last commit).
- Merge commit. (PR submitter to rebase and squash before merges).
- To be decided later.
The maintainer may still request the contributor to squash and rebase, to make sure that merges and commit messages are clarified.
-->

I agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).
